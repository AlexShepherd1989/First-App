# Simple C++ Console Calculator

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This is a simple console-based calculator written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations: **addition** and **subtraction**.
The program uses an `enum` to represent operations and handles exceptions for invalid input or incorrect operator selection.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Addition of two numbers  
- Subtraction of two numbers  
- Displays a list of available operations  
- Handles invalid input (e.g., when the user enters a non-numeric value)  
- Handles errors when the selected operator does not exist  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```

project/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Calculator.h      # Header file with the Operators enum and Calculate function prototype â”œâ”€â”€ Calculator.cpp    # Implementation of the Calculate function â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp          # Program entry point â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Documentation

> âš  Note: In your code, the file is named `Calcualtor.h` (typo). It's recommended to rename it to `Calculator.h` for clarity.

## ðŸ›  Compilation & Run

### Compile with g++:
```bash
g++ main.cpp Calculator.cpp -o calculator
````

### Run:

```bash
./calculator
```

## ðŸ“‹ Example Output

```
Enter first value: 5
Enter second value: 3
Select operator:
1. Sum
2. Sub
1
Result: 8
```

## âš  Possible Errors

- **Invalid input! Please enter a number.** â€” occurs if a non-numeric value is entered.
- **Error: Invalid operator** â€” occurs if the selected operator number is not in the list.

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for Improvement

- Add multiplication and division
- Add division-by-zero checks
- Support operator input as symbols (`+`, `-`)
- Use `double` instead of `float` for higher precision
